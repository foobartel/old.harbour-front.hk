        <h2>Design for Real!</h2>
        <p>Just in time for the end of the summer holidays (or at least almost), we'll be back with another edition of HF, pondering the many different perceptions of design.</p>
        <p>What can you expect? Practical take-aways. A nice crowd and some drinks. Sit back and relax while you learn new things and meet new people at our supporting co-working space <a href="http://www.thehive.com.hk">The Hive</a>.</p>
        <p>When: Wednesday, August 18th, 7:00pm - 9:00pm</p>
        <p>You can <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/harbour-front-monthly-8-fast-food-design-tickets-17963416061">register via Eventbrite</a> or at the door on the evening of the event. You can follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/harbourfronthk">Twitter</a> for the latest updates and we're on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/HarbourFrontHK/">Meetup</a> too.</p>

        <h2>Fast Food Design</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle">(or how we somehow got it all backwards)</h3>
        <p>Design is an ambiguous and poorly understood concept: anyone with access to Adobe creative cloud thinks themselves a designer. </p>
        <p>The startup/agile movement demanded quick and iterative results: generators for logos and websites. But more often than not, these fast-food products don't cure your business challenge: they're a placebo at best, satisfying our immediate hunger but damaging our health. They were not 'designed' in the original sense of the word. It's our task as designers to restore the real potential and value of design for our clients and partners.</p>
