          <p>ZURB, the creators of Foundation, will soon be landing and Harbour Front Web Days is rolling out the red carpet. We're joining forces to bring you a three-day design extravaganza.</p>
          <p>On the first night, ZURB will discuss digital product design and why it's the most important thing we need to be doing.</p>
          <p>The next two nights will focus solely on responsive web design. You'll get a chance to ask questions to the ZURB team about why designing responsively is important in our multi-device world and how to do it. There'll be roundtable discussions, talks, workshops and swag! Oh, and we'll have snacks on hand and something to wash them down with.</p>

					<h3>Day 1: Zurb - Design for People</h3>
					<p>ZURB has been practicing product design since 1998, long before people even realized they were building digital products not just websites. Yet most companies are still struggling with the concept of product design in a digital world. But they don't have to. You'll learn how you can elevate your game and design online products that everyone will want to use.</p>

					<h3>Day 2: Building for the Responsive Web</h3>
					<p>We'll get into the nitty-gritty of front-end development on this night. ZURB will give a talk about why frameworks are important to responsive design while exploring how they built Foundation and what the future holds for frameworks. You'll also have the chance to win a Foundation Yeti t-shirt! Oh, and the ZURBians will have stickers to give out as well.</p>
					<p>A roundtable discussion with the ZURBians (yep, that's what they call themselves) will follow,  where designers, marketers and their clients can ask any questions they might have about responsive design. There'll also be a mixer with drinks and food, courtesy of <a href="http://mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a>. We'll also have some MailChimp swag to give away, so get your questions ready!</p>
