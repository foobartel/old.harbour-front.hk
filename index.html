        <h2>Exploring Sass</h2>
        <p>Sass styling by Gregor Wilson</p>
        <p>Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.</p>
        Gregor Wilson from Pixelcabin will be giving us an introduction to Sass. He will go into detail about some more advanced tips &amp; tricks which can be done with Sass that may not be apparent at first sight. He will will also elaborate about other frameworks and libraries that can nicely work alongside and integrate with Sass. </p>
                <p>
        Originally from Scotland, Gregor spent many a long winter in his attic with the family's first computer creating websites for cars, animations and other kids at his school. While pursuing a degree in Business &amp; Law, his love of coding never faltered, so it was only a matter of time until his passions came together at pixelcabin. </p>
