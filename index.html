        <h2>The Future Of Devtools With Remotedebug</h2>
        <p>Why not debug IE11 using Chrome Dev Tools?</p>
        <p>As a webdeveloper developing for different browsers, Kenneth, like everyone, always worked with several tools. As this is not a very efficient process, he wondered how he could make things more practical and efficient. </p>
        <p>During this past year he had the pleasure to discuss RemoteDebug with great minds from Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Adobe, W3C, and many others. When he announced his <a href="http://remotedebug.org/">RemoteDebug initiative</a> at the FullFrontal conference, the feedback was overwhelming. It generated 1000+ tweets and 500+ followers in the following days. </p>
        <p>In this talk you will learn more about the current debug process, what can be improved and what we can and can be done about it. </p>
        <p>So if you have always wanted to debug Internet Explorer 11 with the Chrome Dev Tools? After this talk you can :)</p>

        <p>Kenneth Auchenberg has been the tech lead for Citrix in San Francisco, worked for Vodafone and is obsessed with tooling.

        <p>He often speaks in public; in communities, at conferences and in companies.</p>
        <p>Currently he is traveling through Asia and is making a stopover in Hong Kong. We were lucky to hijack and convince him to speak at Harbour Front. </p>
        <p>Over the past year he has focused working on <a href="http://remotedebug.org/">RemoteDebug</a>, an initiative to bring a common remote debugging protocol to today's browsers. </p>
